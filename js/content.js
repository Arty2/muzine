'‘My dear daughter,’ he said, ‘when I am gone be kind to every one, and, above all, cherish the Owl—do cherish the Owl—promise me to cherish the Owl.’\n\n‘But how can I cherish the Owl?’ cried the poor Princess; ‘how can I, unless I know who he is?’\n\nBut the King only answered:\n\n‘Dear Ismara, do promise to cherish the Owl!’\n\nAnd he said nothing else for a long time, until at last the Princess saw that the only way to let him rest in peace was to promise, and she said:\n\n‘I promise, dear father, but still I[6] do wish I knew who or what the Owl is that I am to cherish.’\n\n‘You will see that in good time,’ answered the King. ‘Now, my dear Ismara, I shall die happy, and you will be safe. If you had not promised—however, we will let that rest unsaid. Now wheel the bed to where I can see out of the window.’',
'Leaving the bicycle at "Isham’s "-who volunteers some slight repairs-I take a flying visit by rail to see Niagara Falls, returning the same evening to enjoy the proffered hospitality of a genial member of the Buffalo Bicycle Club. Seated on the piazza of his residence, on Delaware Avenue, this evening, the symphonious voice of the club-whistle is cast adrift whenever the glowing orb of a cycle-lamp heaves in sight through the darkness, and several members of the club are thus rounded up and their hearts captured by the witchery of a smile-a “ smile ” in Buffalo, I hasten to explain, is no kin whatever to a Rocky Mountain “smile” - far be it from it.

'"Twenty-one years of it," said Mr. White, nodding at his wife and son. "When he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse. Now look at him."\n\n"He don’t look to have taken much harm," said Mrs. White, politely.\n\n"I’d like to go to India myself," said the old man, "just to look round a bit, you know."\n\n"Better where you are," said the sergeant-major, shaking his head. He put down the empty glass, and sighing softly, shook it again.\n\n"I should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers," said the old man. "What was that you started telling me the other day about a monkey’s paw or something, Morris?"\n\n"Nothing," said the soldier, hastily. "Leastways nothing worth hearing."\n\n"Monkey’s paw?" said Mrs. White, curiously.\n\n"Well, it’s just a bit of what you might call magic, perhaps," said the sergeant-major, offhandedly.',
'This is your book.\nYou may read it.\nIt tells a story.\nRead about the cows.\nThey give milk.\nIt is milk for you and me.\n\nThe cows are eating.\nThey like green grass.\nThe sun is shining.\nCows need sunshine.\nThey give milk every day.\nIt is milk for you and me.',
'Even the wall paintings, as Shakespeare describes them, are not invention. In the sixteenth century people loved to paint the story of the lost son on the walls of the tavern room, just as in the fifteenth century they pinned up little primitive woodcuts representing St. Christopher. Later we shall see a painter of talent like Hogarth not despise the decoration of taverns as below his genius and embellish with works of his brush the “Elephant Tavern” in Fenchurch Street, where he stayed for a time.',
'"Doesn’t it make you feel nice, Lydia," said Jean, when she saw the telegram, "to have a man in London looking after your interests—a sort of guardian angel—and another guardian angel prowling round your demesne at Cap Martin?"\n\n"You mean Jaggs? Have you seen him?"\n\n"No, I have not seen him," said the girl softly. "I should rather like to see him. Do you know where he is staying at Monte Carlo?”',
'Thus thinking, thinking, she kept on walking through the snow to weep on her mother’s bosom. Suddenly she remembered, and stood still: her mother was going to follow her to Steenie’s house! She too must be dead in the snow!—Well, let Heaven take all! They were born to die, and it was her turn now to follow her mother! She started again for home, and at length drew near the house.',
'Not a historical personage like Krishna, Shiva is the name given to God in the last aspect of His threefold nature (Creator-Preserver-Destroyer). Shiva, the Annihilator of maya or delusion, is symbolically represented in the scriptures as the Lord of Renunciates, the King of Yogis. In Hindu art He is always shown with the new moon in His hair, and wearing a garland of hooded snakes, ancient emblem of evil overcome and perfect wisdom. The "single" eye of omniscience is open on His forehead.',
'Meanwhile, the "Bordein," on its return journey towards Metemmeh, struck on a sand-bank, and, being heavily laden, could not be floated off. Sir Charles Wilson’s position was now very critical; with his small force he could not have attempted to land on the west bank and attack the enemy, which was entrenched at Wad Habeshi, between him and the British camp at Gubat. It is true that the courage of this body of Dervishes had been considerably shaken by the defeat at Abu Klea; but the fall of Khartum, and the knowledge that Wad en Nejumi with a large force was advancing north to their support, now transformed them into a formidable enemy. A third steamer, the "Safia," was still at Gubat. Sir Charles Wilson therefore sent an officer down stream in a small boat to ask for help; the appeal was promptly responded to, the "Safia" starting, without delay, to the relief of the "Bordein." The enemy hearing of this, at once threw up entrenchments to oppose its progress, and, on its approach, poured on the unfortunate steamer a perfect hail of rifle and cannon shot; but those on board, determined to relieve their comrades in distress, fought most bravely until a shot, penetrating the boiler, disabled the steamer and placed it in the greatest danger. Undismayed, however, the commander set to work, under a heavy fire, to repair the damage; the work was continued during the night, and early the next morning the "Safia" was able to continue her running fight with the Dervishes, eventually succeeding in silencing the guns, and killing the principal Emir, Ahmed Wad Faid, and a considerable number of subordinate Emirs and men. The passage was forced; and Sir Charles Wilson and his men relieved.',
'As he still dreamed of the things which he had most admired, his thought, his remembrance, his will, descended into his fingers, where—without his knowing how—they communicated to the clay that mysterious principle of life which the wisest man is unable to define. The humble works of Jean the potter had marvellous graces. In such a curve, in such a tint, he put some memory of youth, or of an opening blossom, or the very color of the weather, and of joy or sorrow.\n\nIn his hours of repose he walked with his eyes fixed upon the ground, studying the variations in the color of the soil on the cliffs, on the plains, on the sides of the hills.\n\nAnd the wish came to him to model a unique vase, a marvellous vase, in which should live through all eternity something of all the fragile beauties which his eyes had gazed upon; something even of all the brief joys which his heart had known, and even a little of his divine sorrows of hope, regret and love.\n\nHe was then in the full strength and vigor of manhood.',
